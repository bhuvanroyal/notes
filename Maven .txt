Maven :
	-> project management tool
	->Automates repetitive tasks like compiling source code, packaging the application, and running tests
	->Manages dependencies by downloading required libraries (JAR files) from a central repository or a local repository. 		  This ensures everyone working on the project uses the same versions of libraries and avoids conflicts.
